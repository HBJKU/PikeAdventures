          <h2 class="section-heading">The start of the Journey</h2>
          <p>This all started when my wife and I overheard of a possible roadtrip happening this summer. My in-laws were talking about driving out to South Dakota to see some distant family who owns and operates a Cattle Farm. How cool is that?</p>
          <p>Now we had a bunch of questions. How do we get there? Where do we sleep? What will we do along the way? Are we crazy?</p>

          
          <h2 class="section-heading">How do we get there?</h2>

          <p>Flying would of been the easiest and quickest. But we don't do anything that's easy. Our Jeep Grand Cherokee is a lease so even though it has the room, and MPG for the trip we didn't want to add that many miles.</p>
          <p>Most family trips we do in New England are in my daily driver, a 2015 Jeep Wrangler. Now we had to figure out how to pack 4 people into this little jeep, and drive over 4000 miles in a 2 week period.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">The little Jeep that could.</span>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Where do we sleep?</h2>
          <p>We had camped before, but it had been awhile. So we decided to go over to a local State Park and camp for a weekend. We packed up our old tent, some pillows, blankets, food, grillstuff and headed out. At this point we hadn't bought anything to make life easier, and everything was crammed into the Jeep. By the time we got home later that weekend, we all decided to figure something else out. Ground camping as a family of 4, in a Wrangler was not so fun. And while the Jeep was packed nicley going out, coming home it was a hot mess.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/BearBrook_TentSetup.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption text-muted">We didn't feel judged setting up the tent..Not at all!</span>
          <p>After watching some YouTube videos we got the idea of purchasing a Roof Top Tent. It would keep us off the ground, provide some saftey from the wildlife, and hopefully make it easier to find places to camp. Trying to find one that would fit four people proved to be somewhat dificult, but we finally found the SmittyBilt Overlander 2883 XL. We orderd the Tent, a Roof Rack, and a Trailer Hitch Shelf back in May, everything but the Tent was delivered a week later... The Tent, was delivered 1 week before our Trip. Phew!</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Roof Rack Install</h2>
          <p>We officially had two options on getting the Roof Rack setup. The first option was to buy a replacement rear bumper so the Roof Rack could mount directly to the frame. The second was to use the provided mount, and drill into the side of the Jeep. Personally, I've never been a fan of adding new holes to my vehicles body. And while I would of liked to buy a new bumper, we went with option 3.</p>
          <p>Option 3 was to modify the existing rear-bumper so that the Roof Rack could still mount directly to the frame. In theory we only needed to add a single hole for the Roof Rack to sldie through. In practice it didn't end up being that clean. </p>
          <p>The lack of an Air Compressor ended up turning this into an all day project, some of the bolts took forever to remove by hand. But eventually we got everything lined up and ready to go. After mounting the rear brackets, we discovered the two holes we cut wouldn't work. Between the bumpers size, and the slight bend in the lower portion of the Roof Rack we ended up carving out the inside of the bumper with a sawzall, and forcing the bumper into place. </p>
          <p>With the roof rack mounted, it was feeling pretty sturdy. The next step was to re-isntall the hard-top and get ready for the tent!</p>
          <!--Talk about the roof rack here-->
          <h2 class="section-heading">Roof Top Tent Arrives!</h2>
          <p>14 days before our trip, we find out the tent is finally in stock in the warehouse. Finally on July 5th 2019, the tent gets delivered on a tractor trailer. We had anxiously waited for this day for months, we had measured everything to make sure it will fit but most people who use the Roof Top Tents have larger vehicles, so it was hard to find pictures of how it would look.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/JK_TentDelivery.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption text-muted">I've never been this excited to see a Tractor trailer.</span>
           <p>On July 5th 2019, it was about 90 degrees outside. We tried for awhile to get the tent setup, but we were all overheating. Soon we brought the tent inside our apartment where the AC was blasting. Now we would take our time setting up the tent.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/RTT_indoor_setup.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption text-muted">It was a two person job!</span>
          <p>After we finished up inside, Abigail and I had to figure out how to get it on the jeep. This part was not documented, due to extreme heat our cell phone shut off when we tried to video tape it. Safe to say, we lucked out and between the two of us got it ontop of the Jeep!</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/RTT_Outdoor_OnTheJeep.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Making Progress!</span>
          <p>Now that everything was assembled and sitting ontop of the Jeep, we came across the worst part of the process. Luckily we had helpers with little hands who helped pull the wrenches.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Making sure the bolts are tight!</span>
          <p>Wouldn't be a Pike assembled product if there weren't extra parts! (I later figured out that these weren't extra parts). The tent was setup and it was surprisingly roomy! We still had some loose ends to figure out, but it had been a succesful day. </p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">It had been a long day, this cable confused me.</span>
          <p>We put the cover on the Roof Top Tent, and got cleaned up. We took the girls to get Ice Cream, and visit the beach. It was a well earned reward.</p>
