          <h2 class="section-heading">The start of the Journey</h2>
          <p>This all started when my wife and I overheard of a possible roadtrip happening this summer. My in-laws were talking about driving out to South Dakota to see some distant family who owns and operates a Cattle Farm. How cool is that?</p>
          <p>Now we had a bunch of questions. How do we get there? Where do we sleep? What will we do along the way? Are we crazy?</p>

          
          <h2 class="section-heading">How do we get there?</h2>

          <p>Flying would of been the easiest and quickest. But we don't do anything that's easy. Our Jeep Grand Cherokee is a lease so even though it has the room, and MPG for the trip we didn't want to add that many miles.</p>
          <p>Most family trips we do in New England are in my daily driver, a 2015 Jeep Wrangler. Now we had to figure out how to pack 4 people into this little jeep, and drive over 4000 miles in a 2 week period.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">The little Jeep that could.</span>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Where do we sleep?</h2>
          <p>We had camped before, but it had been awhile. So we decided to go over to a local State Park and camp for a weekend. We packed up our old tent, some pillows, blankets, food, grillstuff and headed out. At this point we hadn't bought anything to make life easier, and everything was crammed into the Jeep. By the time we got home later that weekend, we all decided to figure something else out. Ground camping as a family of 4, in a Wrangler was not so fun. And while the Jeep was packed nicley going out, coming home it was a hot mess.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">We didn't feel judged setting up the tent..Not at all!</span>
          <p>After watching some YouTube videos we got the idea of purchasing a Roof Top Tent. It would keep us off the ground, provide some saftey from the wildlife, and hopefully make it easier to find places to camp. Trying to find one that would fit four people proved to be somewhat dificult, but we finally found the SmittyBilt Overlander 2883 XL. We orderd the Tent, a Roof Rack, and a Trailer Hitch Shelf back in May, everything but the Tent was delivered a week later... The Tent, was delivered 1 week before our Trip. Phew!</p>
